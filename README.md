## Overview  
This repository contains Unreal Engine files that can be used to add a stamina feature in a game animation sample or GASP in Unreal Engine 5.5. This feature is designed to integrate a stamina mechanic into survival gameplay, where stamina serves as a key gameplay element. The use case involves tracking and managing stamina as a resource, directly impacting player abilities and creating a more immersive and challenging experience.  

**Note:** This project is still in development, and I plan to add more features in the future.  

## Installation  
To use the files in this repository, you can clone it directly:



git clone (https://github.com/mdsotoke/unreal-engine-stuff)




Then, open the Unreal Engine project files in your preferred version of UE5.

## Features  
- **Stamina System**: Add a stamina mechanic that can be integrated into your survival game.
- **Gameplay Integration**: Directly impacts player actions, such as running, fighting, and other stamina-consuming activities.
- **Open Source**: Free to use and modify.

## Usage  
After cloning the repository, open the project in Unreal Engine and begin exploring the stamina system. Modify the system to fit your project needs, including adjusting stamina usage for different player actions.

### Example Use Case  
In a survival game, use the stamina feature to manage a player's energy during combat or exploration. For instance, running or performing actions may deplete stamina, requiring the player to rest or consume items to restore it.

## Contributing  
Contributions are welcome! If you want to add new features, fix bugs, or enhance the existing stamina system, feel free to create a pull request or open an issue to discuss.
